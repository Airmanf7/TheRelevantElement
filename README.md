# TheRelevantElement

## Executive Summery

Our creation deals heavily with process atomization, data categorization, and analyzation. These three components are essential to the world of FinTech. Using Natural Language Processing modules to better understand data and make actionable decisions with the information obtained to possibly capitalize on investment opportunities, increase market share, or to better serve clients is what Fintech is all about. We have also integrated the means to conduct financial transactions using digital wallets and cryptocurrencies. 

## The Challenge

Our client, a talk show radio host is interested in a more time efficient and effective way to research daily content to discuss with his listeners. Our client has the daily task of searching the internet and sorting through thousands of articles for relevant content to discuss. We were presented with the challenge of creating a way to automate this process for the sake of time efficiency. Our client also is interested in generating social media content for further listener engagement when off air. 

## The Solution

The following packages, applications, and modules were used:
  + Streamlit
  + NewsAPI
  + Flair
  + Google Text to Speech (GTTS)
  + Solidity
  + REMIX
  + Ganache
  + MetaMask
  + Wombo.Art
  + Shutil
  + Selenium / Helium
  + Global (GLOB)

### User Interface
Steamlit was used to create the user interface. The below code was written to create the home page with various tabs.

Here is what the users sees:

The app allows the user to:

_Flair_ was used the analyzie the content of the articles to determine if the article has an overall Positive or Negative setiment.

The _Flair_ module was then used to assign a grade of confidence to the setiment determination.
